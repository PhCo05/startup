You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown

### Elevator pitch

Whether it's to gain, lose, or maintain weight a lot of us, myself included, track the calories we eat in a day so that we can meet our goals. It's a huge pain to have to go write down every food you ate that day and look up the calorie count for each food item and I often find myself forgetting to write things down and getting an inaccurate calorie count at the end of the day. It would be so much easier if there was an app on your phone that you could use to quickly search foods and automatically add them and their corresponding calorie count to your daily total. Such an app would also make it so much easier to track your progress long term by storing your data and providing visuals.
